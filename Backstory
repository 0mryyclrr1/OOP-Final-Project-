Jelian, Goddess of Whispers
Born from the silence between heartbeats, Jelian emerged as the keeper of secrets that mortals and gods alike feared to speak aloud. Her voice is never heard directly but carried through echoes and murmurs,
guiding those who listen with patience. She thrives in twilight, where hidden truths slip through the veil of shadows.


Amihan(Air)
Amihan, child of the northern wind, was gifted with the freedom to roam the skies and the power to carry life or ruin with a single breath. Gentle in spirit yet bound by duty, she calms the seas for travelers
but can summon storms when balance is threatened. Her presence is the promise of change, ever restless and ever watchful.
